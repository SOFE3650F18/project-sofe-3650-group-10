## Work Assessment
The work for the final project was evenly split between the 2 members. 

Mostly through all the iteration we worked together, since all the parts were correlated thus next part could not be done without proper understanding of its antecesor.

Although there were some minor tasks we did in separate, like after defining our users and UC, Mohammed did the Use Case Model. Or like in some iterations, after our desing concepts were defined and initialize Abraham did some of the diagrams.
